# nativescript-view-accessibility
Nativescript plugin for enabling accessiblity features

## Reasoning behind this plugin:
NativeScript is a create framework for developing cross-platform mobil application.

Their support for platform specific accessibility features is very limited as they only implement
those that can be abstracted for both platforms. So you have to enable those features in JavaScript-code
rather than in template.

The goal of this plugin is to implement those feature for both Android and iOS.

It's heavily inspired by React-Native's accessibility API:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility.html

But is written from scratch, extending NativeScript's classes.

### Note:
* accessible (iOS, Android)
  * true/false
* accessibilityTraits (iOS)
  * Comma or space separated list of traits, use one or more values
* accessibilityComponentType (Android)
  * button, radiobutton\_checkedâ€™ and radiobutton\_unchecked
* accessibilityLiveRegion (Android)
  * none, polite, assertive
* importantForAccessibility (Android)
  * yes, no, no-hide-descendants, auto (default)

The following are not implemented (yet)
* accessibilityLabel (NativeScript implements this as automationText. android maps to ContentDescription and iOS to both accessibilityLabel and acccesibilityIdentifier)
* onAccessibilityTap (iOS)
* onMagicTap (iOS)
* sendAccessibilityEvent (Android)

## Using the plugin

```bash
npm i --save @nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext
```

Import in your `app.ts`/`app.js`, just after you import nativescript modules (`NativeScriptModule` if you run `nativescript-angular`)

```typescript
import '@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext';
```
